                <p>Repetition is a great way to list out options on a website because it
                    helps the user be able to identify that those options belong together
                    for one similar purpose. The way repetition is used in this website
                    design is by using the same size images, although every picture is
                    different, they each contain a picture of a person that represents
                    the menu option. This type of design is very well organized and it's
                    easy to work with because of its simplicity.</p>

                <h4>Apple</h4>
                <a href="https://www.apple.com">apple.com</a>

                <p>I was about to use this example for the "White Space and Clean Design",
                    but then I noticed how great of a contrast the first image has, I decided
                    to use this example for contrast instead. It sure
                    is a great way to catch the viewer's eye, especially when it directs
                    them to an ad for the new product they just launched. The color black
                    is deffinitely not a common background for a picture or a website in
                    general, therefore, it was genious of them to use black for the background
                    of their add and white for the font. There's litteraly no better contrast
                    than white on black!

                <p>Nike is one of the only online stores I like to visit. One of the
                    reasons why is because it's well organized and "clean". What makes
                    it look clean is the amount of color white they use all hroughout
                    their site. White is a color that provides peace and neatness. Just
                    like some peple believe that silence is not good, the same thing
                    happens with color. The bottom line is that you can never have "too
                    much" white in a website, as long as you're adding content and other
                    pops of color as Nike did with the pictures of their products all
                    around their site.
